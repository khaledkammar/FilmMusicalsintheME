      <name>Basic Pitch Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the basic pitch histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 128 MIDI pitches, ordered from lowest to highest, and with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch number). Bin 60 corresponds to middle C. The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch in the piece, relative to all other pitches in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Pitch Class Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, ordered in increasing pitch with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number). The first bin corresponds to the most common pitch class in the piece under consideration (it does NOT correspond to a set pitch class). The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Folded Fifths Pitch Class Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the folded fifths pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, and the bins are ordered such that adjacent bins are separated by an ascending perfect fifth. Bin 0 corresponds to C. Enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number. The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Melodic Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of the bin magnitudes of the melodic interval histogram described above. Each bin corresponds to a melodic interval, and the bin index indicates the number of semitones comprising the interval associated with the bin (there are 128 bins in all). For example, bin 0 corresponds to repeated pitches, bin 1 to a melodic interval of one semitone, bin 2 to a melodic interval of 2 semitones, etc. The magnitude of each bin is proportional to the fraction of melodic intervals in the piece that are of the kind associated with the bin (this histogram is normalized). Rising and falling intervals are treated as identical. Melodies are assumed to be contained within individual MIDI tracks and channels, so melodic intervals are found separately for each track and channel before being combined in this histogram. It is also assumed that there is only one melody at a time per MIDI channel (if multiple notes occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick on the same MIDI track and channel, then all notes but the first note on that tick are ignored). Other than this, all notes on the same track and the same channel are treated as if they are part of a single melody. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels (i.e. that they are each separately contained in their own track and channel). Only pitched notes are considered, so all notes on the unpitched MIDI Channel 10 are ignored.</description>

      <name>Vertical Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 127 (a vertical interval of 127 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. The end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is normalized.</description>

      <name>Wrapped Vertical Interval Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the wrapped vertical interval histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each of the bins is associated with a different vertical pitch interval, and is labeled with the number of semitones in that corresponding interval. More specifically, these are numbered from 0 (a unison) to 11 (a vertical interval of 11 semitones). The magnitude of each bin is found by going through a recoding MIDI tick by MIDI tick and noting all vertical intervals that are sounding at each tick, as well as the MIDI velocities of the pair of notes involved in each vertical interval. Intervals larger than 11 semitones are wrapped (e.g. an octave (12 semitones) is added to the bin for unisons (0 semitones)). The end result is a histogram that indicates which vertical intervals are present, and how significant these vertical intervals are relative to one another, with a weighting based on both MIDI velocity and the aggregated durations with which each interval is held throughout the piece. Finally, the histogram is normalized.</description>

      <name>Rhythmic Value Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector, representing a normalized histogram where the value of each bin specifies the fraction of all notes in the music with a rhythmic value corresponding to that of the given bin. The bins are numbered as follows: thirty second notes (or less) [0], sixteenth notes [1], eighth notes [2], dotted eighth notes [3], quarter notes [4], dotted quarter notes [5], half notes [6], dotted half notes [7], whole notes [8], dotted whole notes [9], double whole notes [10] and dotted double whole notes (or more ) [11]. Both pitched and unpitched notes are included in this histogram. Tempo is, of course, not relevant to this histogram. Notes with durations not precisely matching one of these rhythmic note values are mapped to the closest note value (to filter out the effects of rubato or uneven human rhythmic performances, for example). This histogram is calculated without regard to the dynamics, voice or instrument of any given note.</description>

      <description>How much the note density (average number of notes per second) varies throughout the piece.  Takes into account all notes in all voices, including both pitched and unpitched notes. In order to calculate this, the piece is broken into windows of 5 second duration, and the note density of each window is calculated. The final value of this feature is then found by calculating the standard deviation of the note densities of these windows. Set to 0 if there is insufficient music for more than one window.</description>
